# MoveKick
> An app to enable rapid remote surveying for moving companies.

Moving is a painful process. Moving companies depend on sending their employees out to survey the transferee's home and create a moving itenarary. MoveKick is here to replace the painful and time consuming in-person surveying process with a streamlined app for remote surveying.

## Process
- Transferee downloads the MoveKick app from the iTunes app store
- Transferee picks an avaialbe timeslot from the movers schedule for a survey
- At the survey time, the transferee connects to the mover through the app to begin the video survey
- The transferee walks through their home, taking photos of items that need to be moved
- Utilizing cutting edge image recognition software, the app can determine the type and size of the item and add it to the moving itenerary
